                    KAMCO, originally conceived by Kerala Agro Industries Corporation Ltd. (KAIC) as a joint venture between the central and state governments, promotes agro-based industries in Kerala by manufacturing farm equipment, machinery, and implements required for mechanized farming. In 1973, the Government of Kerala decided to separate the manufacturing wing of KAIC to form KAMCO, marking the beginning of our journey.

                    Our first manufacturing unit at Athani in Ernakulam District began with a single product: the Power Tiller, developed through a technical tie-up with Japanâ€™s Kubota Corporation. This versatile machine quickly gained popularity among farmers due to its superior quality and robust performance.

                <p>
                    Over the years, KAMCO expanded its manufacturing units and product range. In 1995, we established a third unit at Kanjikode, Palakkad, for Power Tiller production. The development of new products and technology upgrades remained a priority, leading to the production of the Power Reaper in 1997 and the Super DI Power Tiller in 2005.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our commitment to innovation continued with the introduction of a compact, lightweight 4 HP Petrol Engine Power Weeder/Garden Tiller in 2010 and a 1 HP petrol engine-powered Paddy Weeder in 2014. Today, KAMCO remains dedicated to developing new products and accessories that enhance the utility and durability of our machines.
